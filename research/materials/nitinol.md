**Nickel titanium**, also known as **nitinol**, is a [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal "Metal") [alloy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy "Alloy") of [nickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel") and [titanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium "Titanium").

\[...] Nitinol alloys exhibit two closely related and unique properties: the [shape memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_memory "Shape memory") effect and [superelasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superelasticity "Superelasticity") (also called [pseudoelasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoelasticity "Pseudoelasticity")). Shape memory is the ability of nitinol to undergo [deformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_\(engineering\) "Deformation (engineering)") at one temperature, stay in its deformed shape when the external force is removed
