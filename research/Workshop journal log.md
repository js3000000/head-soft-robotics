I was excused. I just read the brief and the pdf from Natalie Nathalie Guimbretière.

I unpacked my Arduino kit. Then I tried to follow a tutorial from Benjamin where we had to install p5.serial control and build a simple Arduino circuit with a potentiometer that changes the size of a circle in p5 in the browser, locally (with help from Clara)

**First brainstorming and pitch**

We had to pitch our first ideas to Clara and Benjamin. I wanted to work on a robot that flies and minimizes its energy consumption by hovering like common swift. 

I was open for exploration at this point and wondered if I could imagine  a robot that could make loud noise from time to time like the **White Bellbird** or if I could imagine a robot that could detect muons or dark matter and would behave according to its density.

I think Clara and Benjamin didn't get what I wanted to do and suggested me to make a robot that could recycle waste or detect CO2.  We also talked about robot that clean space. As the project already existed, and because I was more interested in something flying in air, I didn't took the bait.

**Plainpalais and Emmaüs**

We went to Plainpalais at the market and Emmaüs to look out for some electronic objects that we could use in our project or just dismantle for educational purpose.

I found a water heater for aquariums and a small computer mouse. I wanted to know how the wheel on the mouse was working. 

**First experimentations**

When we went back to school, we had time to start experimenting. Some classmate was very interested by solar panels. I wanted to learn more about that as well, so, I listened to the discussions she had with Benjamin. We started to make crazy assumption about their power.

**Soldering initiation**

Benjamin showed us how to sold and build a small robot that rotate when exposed to sunlight. It was composed of a small solar panel, a motor, a capacitor, a led and some transistors. Lisa and started to build them. 

## Thursday 08.01

I started to think of the components I would need to make my robot flap its wing. Strings, motors. Benjamin suggested we use conductive thread. 

**Servo ? Stepper ? DC ?**

I looked at other students' experiments in the class with different types of motors, and decided to use a servo motor to make my wing flap.

**Group work or not ?**

I was hesitant this time to work with someone else. I decided, with some classmates, that we would work in parallel on our project, improving our global knowledge of electronics by sharing information and helping each other with a sort of ''studio'' mindset.

**In a bad mood**

For some mysterious reason, while I was doing something I always dreamed of doing, robots, I was in a terrible mood. I think this started with the fact that all the thing I attempted to do didn't work, AT ALL. I was probably tired and should have taken a break.

**Bad mood-ep.2**

We had to make a first presentation for 2PM. So, I builded I paper prototype to show to my peers. At this point, I really had the feeling that I could have done it pretty earlier, almost two days ago. I was still in a very bad mood, and it was slowing my activities.

I was looking for microphones, at least three of them, to make a prototype that folds according to wind direction. Unfortunately, the Digital Pool was closed and their was no way for me to find microphones. Fortunately, I had one in my own arduino kit.

I had to lower my expectations and humble myself.

**Multimeters and photons.**

Elena (my classmate) and I really wanted to understand how solar panels were working. We were using a halogen lamp that Elena had found in Emmaüs to enlighten the panel.

We were trying to measure amperes coming out from a big solar panel she brought. We couldn't get any coherent numbers. Pablo, our assistant, made us realize that the multimeters we were using for days were cooked...

## Saturday 10.01

Searching for e-waste at home.

## Sunday 11.01

Searching for e-waste at home. Found a bunch of smartphone and adapters that I put it in a large luggage.

## Monday 12.01

**Bad mood - ep.3**

I still believed that I could find more micrphones, so I went to the Digital pool again, finding the door closed. I have lost precious hours finding ways to reach them. I should have let this go on Friday... but I couldn't.

**Making the robot**

I finally started to test detectors with a servo motor. Nothing was working, even though I followed the tutorial from the arduino book. Clara made me realize that I had the wiring wrong... The + and the - were inverted on my board. I promised not to make this mistake again (of course it will happen again).

**All about detection**

I started with a MQ2 detector that was suppose to detect CO2, but we realised that it was detecting butane... Then, Andreia, our other assistant told me about a heat detector that I could use. I tried it. It wasn't working at first. Sending output value of 300°C. Well, guess what ? I had the circuit wrong again. Benjamin came and corrected it, and then, everything ran smoothly.

Anyway, I wasn't really convinced by this device.

## Wednesday 14.01

Making the code for the flapping. I wanted it to look like it was reacting to wind. So, i tried to make an artificial non linear response to the blow on the mic. I tested two different methods. In the end, the simpliest one was the best.

## Thursday 15.01

I really wanted to have a hovering effect under my paper prototype. I found a fan in the lab room that was working well. I put it into a black box and I hung the prototype over it. It took me hours. Then I had little time to make the arduino circuit work. I had the code from the day before, but I didn't had the time to fine tune the whole installation. I also had to prepare slide for the presentation. As time passed, It became clear that I will have to make a choice between a working demo and slides for the presentation.

## Friday 16.01

We prepared the exhibition for the open days.

## Saturday 17.01

Open days at HEAD.
